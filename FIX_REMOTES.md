# Fix Remote Configuration

## Current Issue
Your repository is cloned directly from the upstream Open WebUI repository, not from a personal fork. This needs to be fixed to prevent accidental pushes.

## Solution Steps

### Option 1: Create and Use Your Fork (Recommended)

1. **Fork on GitHub**
   - Go to https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui
   - Click "Fork" button in the top right
   - Create a fork under your GitHub account

2. **Add Your Fork as Remote**
   ```bash
   # Add your fork (replace YOUR-USERNAME)
   git remote add myfork https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/open-webui.git
   
   # Or if using SSH
   git remote add myfork git@github.com:YOUR-USERNAME/open-webui.git
   ```

3. **Push to Your Fork**
   ```bash
   # Push current branch to your fork
   git push myfork custom-dpl-integration
   
   # Set upstream tracking
   git branch --set-upstream-to=myfork/custom-dpl-integration
   ```

### Option 2: Keep Local Only (No GitHub)

If you don't want to push to GitHub at all:

1. **Remove all remotes**
   ```bash
   git remote remove origin
   git remote remove upstream
   ```

2. **Work locally only**
   ```bash
   # Your changes stay on your machine
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your changes"
   ```

### Option 3: Private Repository

1. **Create a private repo on GitHub**
2. **Add as remote**
   ```bash
   git remote add private https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/xynthorai-open-webui-private.git
   git push private custom-dpl-integration
   ```

## Current Safety Measures

✅ Push to both `origin` and `upstream` is DISABLED
✅ Pre-push hook installed to prevent accidental pushes
✅ Working on custom branch `custom-dpl-integration`

## Testing Your Setup

```bash
# This should fail
git push origin main
# fatal: 'DISABLE' does not appear to be a git repository

# After adding your fork, this should work
git push myfork custom-dpl-integration
```

## Important Notes

- NEVER remove the DISABLE setting for origin/upstream push URLs
- Always double-check before pushing: `git remote -v`
- Keep your custom patches in the `patches/` directory
- Consider backing up patches separately: `cp -r patches ~/my-openwebui-patches/`
