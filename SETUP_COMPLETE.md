# âœ… Setup Complete!

## Your Current Configuration

```bash
origin   â†’ git@github-ivan:ivanplzv/open-webui.git (YOUR FORK - safe to push)
upstream â†’ https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui.git (ORIGINAL - push disabled)
```

## Git Remote Naming Convention

- **origin**: Your personal fork (standard Git convention)
- **upstream**: The original repository you forked from

This is the standard naming convention in Git:
- When you clone, the source becomes "origin"
- The original project is called "upstream"

## Your Workflow

### 1. Make changes and push to YOUR fork:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your changes"
git push origin custom-dpl-integration
```

### 2. Sync with upstream Open WebUI:
```bash
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
```

### 3. Your patches are in:
- `/patches/` directory
- Currently on branch: `custom-dpl-integration`

## Safety Features Active

âœ… Push to upstream is DISABLED
âœ… Pre-push hook installed
âœ… Your fork is properly configured as origin
âœ… All Ukrainian comments replaced with English

## Next Steps

1. Continue developing your customizations
2. Create new patches with: `./scripts/create-patch.sh`
3. Build Docker image: `docker build -f Dockerfile.custom -t xynthorai-open-webui:custom .`
4. Update your docker-compose.yml to use the custom image

Your repository is now safely configured! ðŸŽ‰
