## How to Install 🚀

### Installation via Python pip 🐍

TechSecAI Hub can be installed using pip, the Python package installer. Before proceeding, ensure you're using **Python 3.11** to avoid compatibility issues.

1. **Install TechSecAI Hub**:
   Open your terminal and run the following command to install TechSecAI Hub:

   ```bash
   pip install techsecai-hub
   ```

2. **Running TechSecAI Hub**:
   After installation, you can start TechSecAI Hub by executing:

   ```bash
   techsecai-hub serve
   ```

This will start the TechSecAI Hub server, which you can access at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

### Quick Start with Docker 🐳

> [!NOTE]  
> <!-- TODO: Rebrand [TechSecAI Hub]: Original item was 'TechSecAI Hub Documentation link (https://docs.openwebui.com/)' - Requires rewrite. (Point to new docs) -->
> Please note that for certain Docker environments, additional configurations might be needed. If you encounter any connection issues, our detailed guide on [TechSecAI Hub Documentation](https://docs.openwebui.com/) is ready to assist you.

> [!WARNING]
> When using Docker to install TechSecAI Hub, make sure to include the `-v techsecai-hub:/app/backend/data` in your Docker command. This step is crucial as it ensures your database is properly mounted and prevents any loss of data.

> [!TIP]  
> If you wish to utilize TechSecAI Hub with Ollama included or CUDA acceleration, we recommend utilizing our official images tagged with either `:cuda` or `:ollama`. To enable CUDA, you must install the [Nvidia CUDA container toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/dgx/nvidia-container-runtime-upgrade/) on your Linux/WSL system.

### Installation with Default Configuration

- **If Ollama is on your computer**, use this command:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway -v techsecai-hub:/app/backend/data --name techsecai-hub --restart always ghcr.io/techsecai-hub/techsecai-hub:main
  ```

- **If Ollama is on a Different Server**, use this command:

  To connect to Ollama on another server, change the `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` to the server's URL:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 -e OLLAMA_BASE_URL=https://example.com -v techsecai-hub:/app/backend/data --name techsecai-hub --restart always ghcr.io/techsecai-hub/techsecai-hub:main
  ```

- **To run TechSecAI Hub with Nvidia GPU support**, use this command:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 --gpus all --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway -v techsecai-hub:/app/backend/data --name techsecai-hub --restart always ghcr.io/techsecai-hub/techsecai-hub:cuda
  ```

### Installation for OpenAI API Usage Only

- **If you're only using OpenAI API**, use this command:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 -e OPENAI_API_KEY=your_secret_key -v techsecai-hub:/app/backend/data --name techsecai-hub --restart always ghcr.io/techsecai-hub/techsecai-hub:main
  ```

### Installing TechSecAI Hub with Bundled Ollama Support

This installation method uses a single container image that bundles TechSecAI Hub with Ollama, allowing for a streamlined setup via a single command. Choose the appropriate command based on your hardware setup:

- **With GPU Support**:
  Utilize GPU resources by running the following command:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 --gpus=all -v ollama:/root/.ollama -v techsecai-hub:/app/backend/data --name techsecai-hub --restart always ghcr.io/techsecai-hub/techsecai-hub:ollama
  ```

- **For CPU Only**:
  If you're not using a GPU, use this command instead:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 -v ollama:/root/.ollama -v techsecai-hub:/app/backend/data --name techsecai-hub --restart always ghcr.io/techsecai-hub/techsecai-hub:ollama
  ```

Both commands facilitate a built-in, hassle-free installation of both TechSecAI Hub and Ollama, ensuring that you can get everything up and running swiftly.

After installation, you can access TechSecAI Hub at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Enjoy! 😄

### Other Installation Methods

<!-- TODO: Rebrand [TechSecAI Hub]: Original item was 'TechSecAI Hub Documentation link (https://docs.openwebui.com/getting-started/)' - Requires rewrite. (Point to new docs) -->

### Troubleshooting

<!-- TODO: Rebrand [TechSecAI Hub]: Original item was 'TechSecAI Hub Documentation link (https://docs.openwebui.com/troubleshooting/)' - Requires rewrite. (Point to new docs) -->
Encountering connection issues? Our [TechSecAI Hub Documentation](https://docs.openwebui.com/troubleshooting/) has got you covered. For further assistance and to join our vibrant community, visit the [TechSecAI Hub Discord](https://discord.gg/5rJgQTnV4s).

#### TechSecAI Hub: Server Connection Error

If you're experiencing connection issues, it’s often due to the WebUI docker container not being able to reach the Ollama server at 127.0.0.1:11434 (host.docker.internal:11434) inside the container . Use the `--network=host` flag in your docker command to resolve this. Note that the port changes from 3000 to 8080, resulting in the link: `http://localhost:8080`.

**Example Docker Command**:

```bash
docker run -d --network=host -v techsecai-hub:/app/backend/data -e OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:11434 --name techsecai-hub --restart always ghcr.io/techsecai-hub/techsecai-hub:main
```

### Keeping Your Docker Installation Up-to-Date

In case you want to update your local Docker installation to the latest version, you can do it with [Watchtower](https://containrrr.dev/watchtower/):

```bash
docker run --rm --volume /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock containrrr/watchtower --run-once techsecai-hub
```

In the last part of the command, replace `techsecai-hub` with your container name if it is different.

Check our Updating Guide available in our <!-- TODO: Rebrand [TechSecAI Hub]: Original item was 'TechSecAI Hub Documentation link (https://docs.openwebui.com/getting-started/updating)' - Requires rewrite. (Point to new docs) -->[TechSecAI Hub Documentation](https://docs.openwebui.com/getting-started/updating).

### Using the Dev Branch 🌙

> [!WARNING]
> The `:dev` branch contains the latest unstable features and changes. Use it at your own risk as it may have bugs or incomplete features.

If you want to try out the latest bleeding-edge features and are okay with occasional instability, you can use the `:dev` tag like this:

```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:8080 -v techsecai-hub:/app/backend/data --name techsecai-hub --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway --restart always ghcr.io/techsecai-hub/techsecai-hub:dev
```

### Offline Mode

If you are running TechSecAI Hub in an offline environment, you can set the `HF_HUB_OFFLINE` environment variable to `1` to prevent attempts to download models from the internet.

```bash
export HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1
```
